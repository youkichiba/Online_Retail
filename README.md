My answers: 

The UK gives us the most amount of sales revenue by far. The difference between the UK and the second highest country (Netherlands) is ~6,950K 

The customer that brings in the most sales revenue is customer ID #14646 from the Netherlands. This customer alone makes up ~98% of sales revenue coming from Netherlands.

The month that brought in the least amount of sales revenue was February 2011, bringing in only ~442K. Most months tend to stay in the 400K to 600K range but there is a drastic increase during the months September,October, and November. This could be a seasonal trend that the marketing team may want to capitalize on.
